# Footer Height Reduction

## Changes Made

The footer component has been modified to address the issue: "esta muy alto, podemoms omitir los enlases ya tenemos el menu" (it's too tall, we can omit the links since we already have the menu).

### Removed Elements
- Removed the navigation links section (`footer-links` div) since these links are already present in the Header menu
- Removed the RouterLink import from the script section as it's no longer needed
- Removed the CSS styles for `.footer-links` and `.link-group` classes

### Height Reduction
- Reduced overall padding in the footer from `1.5rem 1rem 0.5rem` to `0.8rem 1rem 0.3rem`
- Changed alignment to center items vertically for better spacing
- Reduced margin-bottom for the footer-content from `1.5rem` to `0.8rem`
- Reduced margin-bottom for footer-logo and social-container from `1rem` to `0.5rem`
- Reduced font sizes:
  - Company name: from `1.5rem` to `1.3rem`
  - Tagline: from `0.9rem` to `0.8rem`
  - Social heading: from `1.1rem` to `1rem`
  - Copyright text: from `0.9rem` to `0.8rem`
- Made social buttons smaller:
  - Size: from `40px` to `32px`
  - Font size: from `1.5rem` to `1.2rem`
  - Gap between buttons: from `15px` to `10px`
- Reduced padding-top in the footer-bottom from `1rem` to `0.5rem`

### Mobile Layout
- Updated the mobile media query to maintain a row layout instead of stacking elements vertically
- Adjusted width properties for better display on small screens

These changes have significantly reduced the height of the footer while maintaining its functionality and visual appeal.
